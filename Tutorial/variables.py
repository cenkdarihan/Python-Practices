# Creating Variables

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x) # 5
print(y) # John 
         
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)    # Sally
            
# Casting

x = str(3)    # if we print x, it will be '3'
y = int(3)    # if we print y, it will be 3
z = float(3)  # if we print z, it will be 3.0

# Get the Type

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))  # class'int'
print(type(y))  # class'str'

# Single or Double Quotes?

x = "John"           # is the same as
x = 'John'           # Ä°f we print x, it prints "John" in two situation.

# Case-Sensitive

a = 4
A = "Sall"  # A will not overwrite a
